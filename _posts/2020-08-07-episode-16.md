The world is still very much in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic - but the blame game has already begun. China, where the virus was first reported last December, has been singled out by many countries as the culprit - or scapegoat, depending on your viewpoint. One major consequence of the scramble to apportion guilt has been a surge in anti-Asian sentiment, especially in the U.S. But how new is this phenomenon there? What are its roots, and how has it changed into what we see today? To discuss this, we're joined by Christine Yano, Professor of Anthropology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and President of the Association for Asian Studies (AAS). And we also speak to Jennifer Pan [(@jenjpan)](https://twitter.com/jenjpan?lang=en), a political scientist at Stanford University, about her study on how anti-Chinese discrimination seems to boost support for the Chinese political system amongst Chinese students in the U.S.
