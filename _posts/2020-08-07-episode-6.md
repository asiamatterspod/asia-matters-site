There's only been one story in the region over the last few weeks: the coronavirus, or COVID-19, and its spread from Wuhan to the rest of China, then Asia, now the world. There's still a lot we don't know about the virus itself, and even analysis of its handling by the Chinese authorities seems premature. Instead, this week we're looking back into the past to see what, if anything, we can learn from previous epidemics in China. Our guest this episode is Professor Sian Griffiths, who co-chaired Hong Kong's enquiry into the SARS epidemic in 2003.
