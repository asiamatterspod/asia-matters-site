Welcome to another episode of Asia Matters, lockdown style. This week, Vincent and Andrew are joined by Courtney Fung [(@CourtneyFung)](https://twitter.com/courtneyfung?lang=en) of the University of Hong Kong and Rush Doshi [(@RushDoshi)](https://twitter.com/rushdoshi?lang=en) of the Brookings China Strategy Initiative in Washington, to discuss whether the pandemic really represents a moment for China to subvert the global order. Is this conversation more about Beijing's readiness to usurp Washington's leading role or the U.S.'s inability to get its act together in this particular event? And are we too obsessed with the U.S. vs. China paradigm when speaking about this issue?
