There was plenty to digest from China's coronavirus-delayed "Two Sessions" (Lianghui) annual political gathering last week - so much so that we've got a bumper episode for you. The new national security law for Hong Kong is what's grabbed most of the headlines, but eyebrows were raised too by the absence of an annual growth target for the country for the first time in many years. In the latest of our socially distanced podcasts, Andrew and Vincent are joined by guests from the U.K., the Netherlands and China. Professor Shaun Breslin of the University of Warwick and Professor Dingding Chen [(@ChenDingding)](https://twitter.com/chendingding?lang=en) of Jinan University in Guangzhou discuss the political fallout from the meeting. And then Dr. Jue Wang [(@JueWangLeiden)](https://twitter.com/juewangleiden?lang=en) takes us through what the Lianghui revealed about China's economy, and how it's faring in the pandemic-stricken world.
