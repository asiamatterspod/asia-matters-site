A bumper episode for a hugely important topic - the tech industry in Asia. Yale's Jing Tsu joins Andrew to discuss the history behind China's drive to become a global technological power. Later, Julian Gewirtz [(@JulianGewirtz)](https://twitter.com/juliangewirtz?lang=en) of Harvard and Newley Purnell [(@newley)](https://twitter.com/newley) of the Wall Street Journal take a broader look at the tech scene across the region (specially featuring the horns of Delhi's Ola drivers in the background).
