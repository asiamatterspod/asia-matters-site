China's economy is facing its biggest challenges for years as growth slows and debt piled up. How worried should we be? This episode, Andrew is joined by Stephen Roach, former Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and Senior Fellow at Yale University's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs; and Dinny McMahon, author of the book "China's Great Wall of Debt", which chronicles the country's growing debt problem. A note to listeners - this episode was recorded before the true scale of the coronavirus outbreak was revealed.
