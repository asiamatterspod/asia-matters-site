  <p>By Dinny McMahon
  <br> <i>China's Great Wall of Debt</i> is a penetrating examination of the country's opaque financial system and the complex factors that have brought the country to the brink of crisis. Anchored by stories of China's cities and its people, the narrative takes readers inside the country's ghost cities, zombie companies, and regulatory institutions as it explains how things got so bad, why fixing the problems is so hard, and what the economic outlook means for China and for the rest of us.
