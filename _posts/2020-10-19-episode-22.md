When Joko Widodo, widely known as Jokowi, became president of Indonesia in 2012 it completed a stunning rise for a political outsider who had spent much of his previous life running a furniture making company. With his mastery of retail politics and business know-how, Jokowi seemed set to cut through the bureaucracy and corruption that have bedevilled the development of Indonesia, one of the world’s most populous nations with around a quarter of a billion people. Six years on, and now into his second term as president, it’s time for a report card on Jokowi’s presidency. In this episode, we are joined by Ben Bland, a long time journalist and now director of the South East Asia programme at the Lowy Institute. Ben’s recently published book [*Man of Contradictions*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085ZC2M3W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B085ZC2M3W&linkCode=as2&tag=asiamatterspo-20&linkId=aa72eab75acd0eee7ee342e2581ea926) charts Jokowi’s rise and assesses his presidency to date, explaining why he has disappointed so many expectations both at home and abroad. Later in the programme Dewi Fortuna Anwar, research professor at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, gives us the view from inside the country of why it has been so hard for Jokowi to achieve his goals.

  By Ben Bland
  <br> As he gets to work in his second and final term, will Indonesian President Joko Widodo deliver on his grand ambitions? Or will Indonesia once more fall short of expectations? Man of Contradictions, the first English-language political biography of Jokowi, examines how he became so popular, what makes him tick, and why he will struggle to remake Indonesia. The key to understanding Jokowi lies not in uncovering some core inner convictions but in embracing his contradictions.
