We turn again to the Korean peninsula in this week's episode, another collaboration with CSDS.

We often talk about North Korea's future in terms of how the issue plays out in the region's broad geopolitical rivalry, and between the US and China. Less discussed is how the issue plays out in South Korea - which technically remains at war with its northern neighbour - and whose interest in the matter is existential.

Seoul's approach to the DPRK is set to come more sharply into focus in the coming months, with candidates gearing up for next spring’s presidential elections, where a successor to Moon Jae-in will be chosen.

So what shapes South Korean attitudes towards North Korea? How united has the country been behind Moon’s approach over the last few years? And what might change as the country enters a period of new leadership?

Joining us we have Dr Jina Kim, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, who specializes in North Asian security issues and has also advised the South Korean government.

Our other guest is Ramon Pacheco Pardo, the Korea Chair at the Centre for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy at the Brussels School of Governance.

CSDS the centre is home to a rich expertise on Asia, and is working to enhance understanding of Asia’s security matters in Europe and promote greater engagement between the two regions.
