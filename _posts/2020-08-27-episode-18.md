This episode, we present - the inaugural Asia Matters Book Club episode. China has dominated the headlines this summer - and if you're looking for a good book to help you understand the country better, we have three excellent suggestions. *The Wall Street Journal*'s Lingling Wei [(@Lingling_Wei)](https://twitter.com/Lingling_Wei) is back to talk through her new book, [*Superpower Showdown*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062953052/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0062953052&linkCode=as2&tag=asiamatterspo-20&linkId=a796c3339a616963cea9aee0778839b3). Co-authored with her colleague Bob Davis [(@bobdavis187)](https://twitter.com/bobdavis187), it's a detailed look at the U.S. - China trade war and what its lasting effects on both countries might be. If you're not in the mood for current affairs, veteran journalist Michael Schuman's [(@MichaelSchuman)](https://twitter.com/MichaelSchuman) [*Superpower Interrupted: The Chinese History of the World*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1541788346/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1541788346&linkCode=as2&tag=asiamatterspo-20&linkId=4901c6450e578b3c1808cfedd39da62a), takes readers back thousands of years. As the name suggests, it's a rundown of the country's history as it's perceived in China itself, rather than by external observers. And finally, *Bloomberg Economics*' chief economist Tom Orlik [(@TomOrlik)](https://twitter.com/TomOrlik) has written [*China: The Bubble That Never Pops*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0190877405/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0190877405&linkCode=as2&tag=asiamatterspo-20&linkId=3df82debc0bbdd1c6b153b7f4e9d3c20), to explore the resilience of the modern Chinese economy. Despite years of dire warnings it's on the brink of collapse, it hasn't yet - but why?

  <br>This is the inside story of the US–China trade war, how relations between these superpowers  unraveled, darkening prospects for global peace and prosperity, as told by two Wall Street Journal reporters, one based in Washington, D.C., the other in Beijing, who have had more access to the decision makers in the White House and in China’s Zhongnanhai leadership compound than anyone else.

  <br>This global history as the Chinese would write it gives brilliant and unconventional insights for understanding China's role in the world, especially the drive to "Make China Great Again." We in the West routinely ask: "What does China want?" The answer is quite simple: the superpower status it always had, but briefly lost. For the Chinese, the question was never if they could reclaim their former dominant position in the world, but when.

  <br>The Chinese economy appears destined for failure, the financial bubble forever in peril of popping, the real estate sector doomed to collapse, the factories fated for bankruptcy. And yet, against the odds and against expectations, growth continues, wealth rises, international influence expands. Tom Orlik, a veteran of more than a decade in Beijing, turns the spotlight on China's fragile fundamentals, and resources for resilience.
