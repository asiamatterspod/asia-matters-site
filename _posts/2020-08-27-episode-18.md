This episode, we present - the inaugural Asia Matters Book Club episode. China has dominated the headlines this summer - and if you're looking for a good book to help you understand the country better, we have three excellent suggestions. *The Wall Street Journal*'s Lingling Wei [(@Lingling_Wei)](https://twitter.com/Lingling_Wei) is back to talk through her new book, *Superpower Showdown*. Co-authored with her colleague Bob Davis [(@bobdavis187)](https://twitter.com/bobdavis187), it's a detailed look at the U.S. - China trade war and what its lasting effects on both countries might be. If you're not in the mood for current affairs, veteran journalist Michael Schuman's [(@MichaelSchuman)](https://twitter.com/MichaelSchuman) *Superpower Interrupted: The Chinese History of the World*, takes readers back thousands of years. As the name suggests, it's a rundown of the country's history as it's perceived in China itself, rather than by external observers. And finally, *Bloomberg Economics*' chief economist Tom Orlik [(@TomOrlik)](https://twitter.com/TomOrlik) has written *China: The Bubble That Never Pops*, to explore the resilience of the modern Chinese economy. Despite years of dire warnings it's on the brink of collapse, it hasn't yet - but why?
