This week we set our sights on Japan and South Korea, East Asia's most prominent middle powers.

With the United States and China showing no sign of backing away from confrontation, we look at what it means for two countries caught between them geographically and politically.

What roles do they see themselves taking on as the Asia-Pacific becomes ever more fractious?  Both are major economic players, with important clout both in their own sphere and further afield. The decisions they make could have a significant impact on some of the most pressing challenges facing the region.

Is this new era of competition ripe with opportunity, or fraught with danger? And what, if anything, are they doing to make Asia a safer place?

Haruko Satoh, Professor at the Osaka School of International Public Policy in Japan, is back with us for this episode, and Brendan Howe, Professor of International Relations at Ewha Womans University in South Korea, joins us too.  Chatham House's Bill Hayton is our host again this week.
