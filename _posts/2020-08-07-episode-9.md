Welcome to podcasting in a time of COVID-19. The new coronavirus has run rampant throughout the world and disrupted the global economy, transport and everyday life (including our studio access). But the show must go on - so joining Andrew and Vincent this episode on a four-way Skype chat are Dr. Parag Khanna [(@paragkhanna)](https://twitter.com/paragkhanna), managing director of strategic advisory firm FutureMap and the author of *The Future is Asian*; and Ian Johnson [(@iandenisjohnson)](https://twitter.com/iandenisjohnson), China correspondent for The New York Times. The topic is, of course, the coronavirus - specifically, as the epicentre has switched to Europe and parts of Asia seem almost ready to begin recovering, how Asian countries have differed in their approach to the virus. What can we learn from the various strategies they deployed, and what do they reveal about the different political systems themselves? And taking out our crystal balls - at this early stage are there any clues about how this epoch-defining pandemic will affect the region's geopolitical order?
