The leaders of South Korea and Japan recently held talks for the first time in over a year; their aim, to resolve a long-running trade dispute. Taking this other trade war as their starting point, our experts look at relations between East Asia's two biggest democracies. At a time when U.S. commitment to the region seems less of a given than in the past, and China's ascendancy continues, how is this friction affecting the regional power balance? What are the challenges and opporunities ahead, particularly when it comes to Japan's grand strategy? In our inaugural episode, we are joined by Sheila Smith [(@SheilaSmithCFR)](https://twitter.com/SheilaSmithCFR) of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, and Richard McGregor [(@mcgregorrichard)](https://twitter.com/mcgregorrichard) of the Lowy Institute in Sydney.
