<br>

The leaders of South Korea and Japan recently held talks for the first time in over a year; their aim, to resolve a long-running trade dispute. Taking this other trade war as their starting point, our experts look at relations between East Asia's two biggest democracies. At a time when U.S. commitment to the region seems less of a given than in the past, and China's ascendancy continues, how is this friction affecting the regional power balance? What are the challenges and opporunities ahead, particularly when it comes to Japan's grand strategy? In our inaugural episode, we are joined by Sheila Smith of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, and Richard McGregor of the Lowy Institute in Sydney.

  <br><i>The Party</i> is Richard McGregor’s eye-opening investigation into China’s Communist Party, and the integral role it has played in the country’s rise as a global superpower and rival to the United States. Many books have examined China’s economic rise, human rights record, turbulent history, and relations with the U.S.; none until now, however, have tackled the issue central to understanding all of these issues: how the ruling communist government works.

  By Richard McGregor
  <br>If the United States helped lay the postwar foundations for modern Asia, <i>Asia's Reckoning</i> will reveal how that structure is now crumbling. With unrivalled access to archives in the US and Asia, Richard McGregor has written a tale which blends the tectonic shifts in diplomacy with the domestic political trends and personalities driving them. It is a story not only of an overstretched America, but also of the rise and fall and rise of the great powers of Asia.

  By Richard McGregor
  <br>Xi Jinping has transformed China with a speed and aggression that few foresaw when he came to power in 2012. Finally, he is meeting resistance, both at home among disgruntled officials and disillusioned technocrats, and abroad from an emerging coalition of Western nations that seem determined to resist China’s geopolitical and high-tech expansion. With the United States and China at loggerheads, Richard McGregor outlines how the world came to be split in two.
