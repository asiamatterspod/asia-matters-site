China’s growing clout in the world economy is being matched ever more closely by its rising influence over major international institutions — none more so than the United Nations. For several years now, Chinese leaders have extolled the UN’s virtues as the most authoritative multilateral body in world affairs. But more recently it has taken action to back its rhetoric, becoming the second-biggest contributor to the UN’s financial coffers. Chinese citizens have also taken several leading roles in UN organisations.

Yet China’s growing presence in the UN has come during a period when the institution’s focus has shifted in ways that seem to run counter to Beijing’s interests and beliefs, for example in the UN’s increased willingness to intervene within countries to resolve conflict or protect human rights.

Meanwhile China’s actions at the UN, for example in vetoing several attempts to put more pressure on the government in war-torn Syria, have drawn heavy criticism from major Western powers, and raised questions about whether its approach to international relations conflicts with the UN’s developing conception of its own role in global affairs.

To help unpick and explain some of these issues we are joined by Professor Rosemary Foot, a senior research fellow in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Oxford. Rosemary’s new book, [‘China, the UN, and Human Protection’](https://amzn.to/3m3GWjS), offers a superb analysis of China and its approach to the UN. We will also hear insights from Courtney Fung, an associate professor in International Relations at the University of Hong Kong who also written and researched extensively on China’s role at the UN.

  By Rosemary Foot
  <br> Over a short period of time, Beijing moved from dismissing the UN to embracing it. How are we to make sense of China's embrace of the UN, and what does its engagement mean in larger terms? This study focuses directly on Beijing's involvement in one of the most contentious areas of UN activity -- human protection -- contentious because the norm of human protection tips the balance away from the UN's Westphalian state-based profile, towards the provision of greater protection for the security of individuals and their individual liberties.

  By Courtney Fung
  <br> Fung offers a rich study of Chinese foreign policy, going beyond works available in breadth and in depth. It draws on an extensive collection of data, including over two hundred interviews with UN officials and Chinese foreign policy elites, participant observation at UN Headquarters, and a dataset of Chinese-language analysis regarding foreign-imposed regime change and intervention. The book concludes with new perspectives on the malleability of China's core interests, insights about the application of status for cooperation and the implications of the status dilemma for rising powers.
