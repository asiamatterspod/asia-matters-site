One of the biggest - and most persistent - stories in the Asia region over the last few years has been North Korea. It may have been pushed out of the headlines recently by the coronavirus pandemic, but as recent missile tests have demonstrated, it's not an issue that's going away any time soon. In this episode, Andrew is joined by Chun In-Bum [(@InBum_Chun)](https://twitter.com/inbum_chun?lang=en), a renowned expert on Korean relations who's a veteran Lieutenant General in the South Korean army, and who briefly served as a security adviser to President Moon Jae-In. To discuss China's role and interests, Tong Zhao [(@zhaot2005)](https://twitter.com/zhaot2005?lang=en), a senior fellow at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, joins us from Beijing as well. NB: This episode was recorded shortly before the coronavirus crisis took hold.
