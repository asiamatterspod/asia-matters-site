It's been called one of the world's biggest financial heists. When the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB was set up in 2009, its purpose was supposedly to develop the country's infrastructure and economy. Instead, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges that $4.5 billion was stolen from it. In this episode, Andrew is joined by Tom Wright [(@TomWrightAsia)](https://twitter.com/tomwrightasia?lang=en), co-author of *Billion Dollar Whale*, the story of the scandal and specifically the fugitive financier at its heart, Jho Low. Mr. Low has released a statement saying that the book "is written with allegations disguised as fact and gossip passed off as legitimate reporting. The narrative is framed to allow the authors to write about celebrities, and models and parties, without ever proving any of the allegations." Mr. Low's whereabouts are unknown, and he continues to evade the authorities - most recently reports claimed he had been sighted in India. The fallout from 1MDB continues elsewhere too - this week the former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is expected to go on trial again for his alleged role in it. Like Mr. Low, he denies all wrongdoing.
