We often talk about geopolitics in terms of superpower competition - at the moment, particularly between the U.S. and China. But where does this leave mid-sized countries like the U.K.? How should they respond to China's already large and ever-growing influence over global affairs - do they ned to pick sides, or is a more delicate balancing act required? Issues like Huawei and Hong Kong lend these questions a particular prominence in the U.K. at the moment, so this week we've invited two former British diplomats to debate them. Kerry Brown is a  Professor of Chinese Studies at King's College London and an Associate Fellow at Chatham House; and Matthew Henderson is Director of the Asia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society. What does the U.K.'s experience of dealing with China teach us about an emerging new world order? And most pressingly for the U.K. and countries like it - what leverage, if any, do middle powers have in it?
