# About

Asia Matters is the podcast that goes beyond the headlines with experts from around the globe to help explain what's really going on in Asia today. Started in 2019, we look into some of the biggest stories in Asia that are not covered by international media, but that are still important in shaping the world's most exciting region. We try to cover different regions of Asia, primarily East, South and Southeast Asia. Through our discussions with prominent experts and scholars on Asia, we hope to give listeners an in-depth view of current events and expert opinion on current events and important stories in Asia today.
